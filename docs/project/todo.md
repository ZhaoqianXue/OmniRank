- [ ] **Knowledge Layer**: Integrate literature (e.g., Mengxin Yu) for expert-level theoretical grounding in Agent prompts.
- [ ] **Orchestration & Alignment**: Shift from "Fixed Pipeline" to "Dynamic Task Orchestration" with enhanced semantic alignment (e.g., auto-detecting `bigbetter` logic).
- [ ] **H-I-T-L Co-evolution**: Implement clinician-loop feedback to allow Agent refinement and configuration strategy learning.
